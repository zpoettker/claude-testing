Trading Journal App

I am making a trading journal app, to track and store trades of users. These trades could be stocks, indicies, futures, forex, crypto, or others. I am currently working on the front-end and will change this prompt when I am done with front-end and moving to the backend.

App experience:

When a user opens the webpage they are greeted with a login screen. Once logged in and authenticated, they are brought to the dashboard page, and they have access to a side bar with tabs of different pages. These tabs include Dashboard, Daily Journal, Notebook, Reports, Resource Center, and Profile. The sidebar will also have a button at the top for uploading trades via a csv file. The web app should have clean sleek UI design, based around the colors grey, green, red, and small amounts of white. 

Pages:

    -Dashboard:

This page is the starting page once logged in, where users will have access to their time based trade metrics such as Net P&L, daily and trade win rates, win/loss ratio, the P&L calendar, Recent trade logs, and a P&L chart. This page will have 2 drop downs, one for the 'account' the user wants to view trades for, as they will be able to upload trades to several seperate accounts in the profile tab. The other drop down will open a small window for date selection for the metrics shown. For example, a few options on the date selection dropdown will be this week, this month, last month, this quarter, YTD, etc, aswell as have 2 calendars for selecting a start and end date. Once the date range is selected the metrics previously described will show metrics within these date ranges, ie. winrate for this week.

    -Daily Journal:

On this page users will have a list on the left side of the screen of days they have added to their calendar via a 'Add Entry' button at the top of the list. Once a day is added, it is added to the list, displaying the date and the p&L for that day. When a user clicks on a day, it pulls up in the main section of the window the days metrics, including the P&L for the day, number of trades, winrate, and other important metrics. Under these metrics is a 'journal' section with a textbox and formatting settings for users to write notes about the day.

    -Notebook: 

The notebook page is a page for users to simply general in general, not specific to any day. The layout will be identical to the daily journal page, however instead of having notes listed by date, they will be listed on the left hand side by titles created by the user. When an entry is clicked on it will not have any entries to display, simply just a journal text area(with formatting options above) for users to type in. 

    -Reports:

This page will have analytic metrics for users to search by. It will have a dropdown menu for date selection like the dashboard screen, and will have all the same metrics in the dashboard screen(except the calendar), as well as other metrics, like P&L seperated by days of the week, times of the day, p&l seperated by ticker, and others.

    -Resource center:

The resource center page will have Frequently asked questions, information on the founder of the web app, as well as customer support contact information.

    -Profile:

Profile page will have the personal information of the user stored for change or reference, will have settings like accounts on profile(different accounts for different trades), and possibly other customization for the app.

    -Upload Trades:

This page will have a dropdown for which account to upload trades to, and will have a dropdown for which broker they are uploading trades from. It will also have an upload box for the user to drop the file. Once the file is uploaded successfully, the user will be navigated back to the dashboard screen, and will get a green prompt professing the successful upload of the trades. If the file is not uploaded successfully, the user will stay on the file upload page, and will receive a red prompt, saying the upload was unsuccessful and why.

    -Landing/Pricing Page:

The landing page will basically be the sale page, where new users can look at what the app will provide, look at reviews, look at pricing options, and ultimately be the first page they ever see. It must be desgined well to leave a great first impression on possible new users.


Tech Stack:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-End: I will need help with what languages and tools are avaliable to me for backend as I am fairly new to it, but currently I am aiming at using Next.JS, SQL, and a database like firebase.

Development Process:

Stage 1: Front-end.

a. Work on dashbaord screen till completed.
b. work on daily journal page
c. work on next page etc. 

Stage 2: Back-end.
